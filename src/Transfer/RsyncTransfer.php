     * mation on what files are being skipped and slightly more information at the end. More than two -v options should only be used if you
     * are debugging rsync.
     *
     * In a modern rsync, the -v option is equivalent to the setting of groups of --info and --debug options.  You can choose to use  these
     * newer  options  in  addition  to,  or in place of using --verbose, as any fine-grained settings override the implied settings of -v.
     * Both --info and --debug have a way to ask for help that tells you exactly what flags are set for each increase in verbosity.
     *
     * However, do keep in mind that a daemon’s "max verbosity" setting will limit how high of a level the various individual flags can  be
     * set  on  the  daemon  side.   For instance, if the max is 2, then any info and/or debug flag that is set to a higher value than what
     * would be set by -vv will be downgraded to the -vv level in the daemon’s logging.

     *
     *     rsync -av /foo/bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/

     *
     * then a file named /tmp/foo/bar/baz.c would be created on the remote machine, preserving its full path.  These  extra  path  elements
     * are called "implied directories" (i.e. the "foo" and the "foo/bar" directories in the above example).
     *
     * Beginning  with  rsync 3.0.0, rsync always sends these implied directories as real directories in the file list, even if a path ele-
     * ment is really a symlink on the sending side.  This prevents some really unexpected behaviors when copying the full path of  a  file
     * that you didn’t realize had a symlink in its path.  If you want to duplicate a server-side symlink, include both the symlink via its

     * --no-implied-dirs option.

     * It  is  also possible to limit the amount of path information that is sent as implied directories for each path you specify.  With a
     * modern rsync on the sending side (beginning with 2.6.7), you can insert a dot and a slash into the source path, like this:
     *
     *     rsync -avR /foo/./bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/
     *
     * That would create /tmp/bar/baz.c on the remote machine.  (Note that the dot must be followed by a slash, so "/foo/."  would  not  be
     * abbreviated.)  For older rsync versions, you would need to use a chdir to limit the source path.  For example, when pushing files:
     *
     *     (cd /foo; rsync -avR bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/)
     *
     * (Note that the parens put the two commands into a sub-shell, so that the "cd" command doesn’t remain in effect for future commands.)
     * If you’re pulling files from an older rsync, use this idiom (but only for a non-daemon transfer):

     *
     * For  instance,  if  a command-line arg or a files-from entry told rsync to transfer the file "path/foo/file", the directories "path"
     * and "path/foo" are implied when --relative is used.  If "path/foo" is a symlink to "bar" on the destination  system,  the  receiving

     * o      In-use binaries cannot be updated (either the OS will prevent this from happening, or binaries that attempt to swap-in  their
     *        data will misbehave or crash).
     *
     * o      The file’s data will be in an inconsistent state during the transfer and will be left that way if the transfer is interrupted

     *
     * o      A file that rsync cannot write to cannot be updated. While a super user can update any  file,  a  normal  user  needs  to  be
     *        granted write permission for the open of the file for writing to be successful.
     *
     * o      The  efficiency of rsync’s delta-transfer algorithm may be reduced if some data in the destination file is overwritten before
     *        it can be copied to a position later in the file.  This does not apply if you use --backup, since rsync is  smart  enough  to

     * This option does NOT necessarily ensure that the pattern of hard links on the destination exactly matches that on the source.  Cases
     * in which the destination may end up with extra hard links include the following:
     *
     * o      If  the  destination  contains extraneous hard-links (more linking than what is present in the source file list), the copying
     *        algorithm will not break them explicitly.  However, if one or  more  of  the  paths  have  content  differences,  the  normal
     *        file-update process will break those extra links (unless you are using the --inplace option).
     *
     * o      If you specify a --link-dest directory that contains hard links, the linking of the destination files against the --link-dest
     *        files can cause some paths in the destination to become linked together due to the --link-dest associations.
     *
     * Note that rsync can only detect hard links between files that are inside the transfer set.  If rsync updates a file that  has  extra
     * hard-link connections to files outside the transfer, that linkage will be broken.  If you are tempted to use the --inplace option to
     * avoid this breakage, be very careful that you know how your files are being updated so that  you  are  certain  that  no  unintended
     * changes happen due to lingering hard links (and see the --inplace option for more caveats).
     *
     * If  incremental  recursion  is  active (see --recursive), rsync may transfer a missing hard-linked file before it finds that another
     * link for that contents exists elsewhere in the hierarchy.  This does not affect the accuracy of the transfer (i.e. which  files  are
     * hard-linked  together),  just its efficiency (i.e. copying the data for a new, early copy of a hard-linked file that could have been
     * found later in the transfer in another member of the hard-linked set of files).  One way to avoid this inefficiency  is  to  disable
     * incremental recursion using the --no-inc-recursive option.

     * --chmod option for a way to modify what rsync considers to be the source permissions.).
     *
     * When this option is off, permissions are set as follows:
     *
     * o      Existing files (including updated files) retain their existing permissions, though the --executability  option  might  change
     *        just the execute permission for the file.
     *
     * o      New  files  get  their  "normal"  permission  bits set to the source file’s permissions masked with the receiving directory’s
     *        default permissions (either the receiving process’s umask, or the  permissions  specified  via  the  destination  directory’s
     *        default  ACL), and their special permission bits disabled except in the case where a new directory inherits a setgid bit from
     *        its parent directory.
     *
     * Thus, when --perms and --executability are both disabled, rsync’s behavior is the same as that of other file-copy utilities, such as
     * cp(1) and tar(1).
     *
     * In  summary:  to  give  destination  files  (both  old and new) the source permissions, use --perms.  To give new files the destina-
     * tion-default permissions (while leaving existing files unchanged), make sure that the --perms option is off and use  --chmod=ugo=rwX
     * (which ensures that all non-masked bits get enabled).  If you’d care to make this latter behavior easier to type, you could define a
     * popt alias for it, such as putting this line in the file ~/.popt (the following defines the -Z option, and includes  --no-g  to  use
     * the default group of the destination dir):
     *
     *     rsync alias -Z --no-p --no-g --chmod=ugo=rwX
     *
     * You could then use this new option in a command such as this one:

     *      rsync -avZ src/ dest/
     *
     * (Caveat: make sure that -a does not follow -Z, or it will re-enable the two "--no-*" options mentioned above.)
     *
     * The  preservation  of the destination’s setgid bit on newly-created directories when --perms is off was added in rsync 2.6.7.  Older
     * rsync versions erroneously preserved the three special permission bits for newly-created files when --perms was off, while  overrid-
     * ing  the destination’s setgid bit setting on a newly-created directory.  Default ACL observance was added to the ACL patch for rsync
     * 2.6.7, so older (or non-ACL-enabled) rsyncs use the umask even if default ACLs are present.  (Keep in mind that it is the version of

    /**
     * A better way to keep partial files than the --partial option is to specify a DIR that will be used to hold the partial data (instead
     * of writing it out to the destination file).  On the next transfer, rsync will use a file found in this dir as data to speed  up  the
     * resumption of the transfer and then delete it after it has served its purpose.
     *
     * Note that if --whole-file is specified (or implied), any partial-dir file that is found for a file that is being updated will simply
     * be removed (since rsync is sending files without using rsync’s delta-transfer algorithm).
     *
     * Rsync will create the DIR if it is missing (just the last dir -- not the whole path).  This makes it easy to  use  a  relative  path
     * (such as "--partial-dir=.rsync-partial") to have rsync create the partial-directory in the destination file’s directory when needed,
     * and then remove it again when the partial file is deleted.
     *
     * If the partial-dir value is not an absolute path, rsync will add an exclude rule at the end of all  your  existing  excludes.   This
     * will prevent the sending of any partial-dir files that may exist on the sending side, and will also prevent the untimely deletion of
     * partial-dir items on the receiving side.  An example: the above --partial-dir option would add the equivalent of "-f ’-p .rsync-par-
     * tial/’" at the end of any other filter rules.
     *
     * If  you are supplying your own exclude rules, you may need to add your own exclude/hide/protect rule for the partial-dir because (1)
     * the auto-added rule may be ineffective at the end of your other rules, or (2) you may wish to override rsync’s exclude choice.   For
     * instance,  if you want to make rsync clean-up any left-over partial-dirs that may be lying around, you should specify --delete-after
     * and add a "risk" filter rule, e.g.  -f ’R .rsync-partial/’.  (Avoid using --delete-before or --delete-during unless you  don’t  need
     * rsync to use any of the left-over partial-dir data during the current run.)
     *
     * IMPORTANT: the --partial-dir should not be writable by other users or it is a security risk.  E.g. AVOID "/tmp".
     *
     * You  can  also set the partial-dir value the RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR environment variable.  Setting this in the environment does not force
     * --partial to be enabled, but rather it affects where partial files go when --partial is specified.  For instance, instead  of  using
     * --partial-dir=.rsync-tmp along with --progress, you could set RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR=.rsync-tmp in your environment and then just use the
     * -P option to turn on the use of the .rsync-tmp dir for partial transfers.  The only times that the --partial option  does  not  look
     * for  this  environment  value  are  (1)  when  --inplace  was specified (since --inplace conflicts with --partial-dir), and (2) when
     * --delay-updates was specified (see below).
     *
     * For the purposes of the daemon-config’s "refuse options" setting, --partial-dir does not imply --partial.  This is so that a refusal
     * of  the  --partial option can be used to disallow the overwriting of destination files with a partial transfer, while still allowing
     * the safer idiom provided by --partial-dir.

     * sively scanning a hierarchy of files using include/exclude/filter rules.

     * ever, keep in mind that excluded files and directories can prevent existing items from being deleted due to an exclude  both  hiding
     * source files and protecting destination files.  See the perishable filter-rule option for how to avoid this.
     *
     * You  can prevent the pruning of certain empty directories from the file-list by using a global "protect" filter.  For instance, this

     * each received temporary file over the top of the associated destination file, but instead must copy it into place.  Rsync does  this

     * Using  this  option  allows  you  to  specify the exact list of files to transfer (as read from the specified FILE or - for standard
     * input).  It also tweaks the default behavior of rsync to make transferring just the specified files and directories easier:.
     *
     * o      The --relative (-R) option is implied, which preserves the path information that is specified for each item in the file  (use
     *        --no-relative or --no-R if you want to turn that off).
     *
     * o      The --dirs (-d) option is implied, which will create directories specified in the list on the destination rather than noisily
     *        skipping them (use --no-dirs or --no-d if you want to turn that off).
     *
     * o      The --archive (-a) option’s behavior does not imply --recursive (-r), so specify it explicitly, if you want it.
     *
     * o      These side-effects change the default state of rsync, so the position of the --files-from option on the command-line  has  no
     *        bearing  on  how  other options are parsed (e.g. -a works the same before or after --files-from, as does --no-R and all other
     *        options).
     *
     * The filenames that are read from the FILE are all relative to the source dir -- any leading slashes are removed and no  ".."  refer-
     * ences are allowed to go higher than the source dir.  For example, take this command:
     *
     *    rsync -a --files-from=/tmp/foo /usr remote:/backup
     *
     * If  /tmp/foo  contains  the string "bin" (or even "/bin"), the /usr/bin directory will be created as /backup/bin on the remote host.
     * If it contains "bin/" (note the trailing slash), the immediate contents of the directory would also be sent (without needing  to  be
     * explicitly  mentioned  in  the file -- this began in version 2.6.4).  In both cases, if the -r option was enabled, that dir’s entire
     * hierarchy would also be transferred (keep in mind that -r needs to be specified  explicitly  with  --files-from,  since  it  is  not
     * implied  by -a).  Also note that the effect of the (enabled by default) --relative option is to duplicate only the path info that is
     * read from the file -- it does not force the duplication of the source-spec path (/usr in this case).
     *
     * In addition, the --files-from file can be read from the remote host instead of the local host if you specify a "host:" in  front  of
     * the  file  (the  host  must  match  one end of the transfer).  As a short-cut, you can specify just a prefix of ":" to mean "use the
     * remote end of the transfer".  For example:
     *
     *    rsync -a --files-from=:/path/file-list src:/ /tmp/copy
     *
     * This would copy all the files specified in the /path/file-list file that was located on the remote "src" host.
     *
     * If the --iconv and --protect-args options are specified and the --files-from filenames are being sent from one host to another,  the
     * filenames will be translated from the sending host’s charset to the receiving host’s charset.
     *
     * NOTE:  sorting  the  list of files in the --files-from input helps rsync to be more efficient, as it will avoid re-visiting the path
     * elements that are shared between adjacent entries.  If the input is not sorted, some path elements (implied directories) may end  up
     * being scanned multiple times, and rsync will eventually unduplicate them after they get turned into file-list elements.

     *        which does not include dirs, symlinks, etc.  Note that rsync 3.1.0 added the word "regular" into this heading.
     *
     * o      Total file size is the total sum of all file sizes in the transfer.  This does not count any size for directories or  special
     *        files, but does include the size of symlinks.
     *
     * o      Total transferred file size is the total sum of all files sizes for just the transferred files.

     * bers in units of 1000 (with a character suffix for larger units -- see below); (3) output numbers in units of 1024.
     *
     * The default is human-readable level 1.  Each -h option increases the level by one.  You can take the level down to 0 (to output num-
     * bers as pure digits) by specifing the --no-human-readable (--no-h) option.
     *
     * The unit letters that are appended in levels 2 and 3 are: K (kilo), M (mega), G (giga), or T (tera).  For  example,  a  1234567-byte
     * file would output as 1.23M in level-2 (assuming that a period is your local decimal point).
     *
     * Backward  compatibility  note:  versions of rsync prior to 3.1.0 do not support human-readable level 1, and they default to level 0.
     * Thus, specifying one or two -h options will behave in a comparable manner in old and new versions as long as you  didn’t  specify  a
     * --no-h option prior to one or more -h options.  See the --list-only option for one difference.

     * This option tells rsync to print information showing the progress of the transfer. This gives a bored user something to watch.  With
     * a modern rsync this is the same as specifying --info=flist2,name,progress, but any user-supplied settings for those info flags takes
     * precedence (e.g. "--info=flist0 --progress").
     *
     * While rsync is transferring a regular file, it updates a progress line that looks like this:
     *
     *       782448  63%  110.64kB/s    0:00:04
     *
     * In  this example, the receiver has reconstructed 782448 bytes or 63% of the sender’s file, which is being reconstructed at a rate of
     * 110.64 kilobytes per second, and the transfer will finish in 4 seconds if the current rate is maintained until the end.
     *
     * These statistics can be misleading if rsync’s delta-transfer algorithm is in use.  For example, if the sender’s file consists of the
     * basis  file  followed  by  additional  data, the reported rate will probably drop dramatically when the receiver gets to the literal
     * data, and the transfer will probably take much longer to finish than the receiver estimated as it was finishing the matched part  of
     * the file.
     *
     * When the file transfer finishes, rsync replaces the progress line with a summary line that looks like this:
     *
     *      1,238,099 100%  146.38kB/s    0:00:08  (xfr#5, to-chk=169/396)
     *
     * In  this  example,  the file was 1,238,099 bytes long in total, the average rate of transfer for the whole file was 146.38 kilobytes
     * per second over the 8 seconds that it took to complete, it was the 5th transfer of a regular file during the current rsync  session,
     * and  there  are 169 more files for the receiver to check (to see if they are up-to-date or not) remaining out of the 396 total files
     * in the file-list.
     *
     * In an incremental recursion scan, rsync won’t know the total number of files in the file-list until it reaches the ends of the scan,
     * but  since  it  starts  to  transfer files during the scan, it will display a line with the text "ir-chk" (for incremental recursion
     * check) instead of "to-chk" until the point that it knows the full size of the list, at which point it will switch to using "to-chk".
     * Thus,  seeing  "ir-chk"  lets  you  know that the total count of files in the file list is still going to increase (and each time it
     * does, the count of files left to check  will increase by the number of the files added to the list).

     * rsync is at least version 2.6.7 (you can use -vv with older versions of rsync, but that also turns on the output  of  other  verbose
     * messages).
     *
     * The  "%i"  escape  has  a  cryptic  output  that  is 11 letters long.  The general format is like the string YXcstpoguax, where Y is
     * replaced by the type of update being done, X is replaced by the file-type, and the other letters represent attributes  that  may  be
     * output if they are being modified.
     *
     * The update types that replace the Y are as follows:
     *
     * o      A < means that a file is being transferred to the remote host (sent).
     *
     * o      A > means that a file is being transferred to the local host (received).
     *
     * o      A  c  means  that a local change/creation is occurring for the item (such as the creation of a directory or the changing of a
     *        symlink, etc.).
     *
     * o      A h means that the item is a hard link to another item (requires --hard-links).
     *
     * o      A . means that the item is not being updated (though it might have attributes that are being modified).
     *
     * o      A * means that the rest of the itemized-output area contains a message (e.g. "deleting").
     *
     * The file-types that replace the X are: f for a file, a d for a directory, an L for a symlink, a D for a device, and a S for  a  spe-
     * cial file (e.g. named sockets and fifos).
     *
     * The  other  letters in the string above are the actual letters that will be output if the associated attribute for the item is being
     * updated or a "." for no change.  Three exceptions to this are: (1) a newly created item replaces each letter  with  a  "+",  (2)  an
     * identical  item  replaces  the  dots with spaces, and (3) an unknown attribute replaces each letter with a "?" (this can happen when
     * talking to an older rsync).
     *
     * The attribute that is associated with each letter is as follows:
     *
     * o      A c means either that a regular file has a different checksum (requires --checksum) or that a  symlink,  device,  or  special
     *        file  has  a  changed value.  Note that if you are sending files to an rsync prior to 3.0.1, this change flag will be present
     *        only for checksum-differing regular files.
     *
     * o      A s means the size of a regular file is different and will be updated by the file transfer.
     *
     * o      A t means the modification time is different and is being updated to the sender’s value  (requires  --times).   An  alternate
     *        value  of  T  means  that the modification time will be set to the transfer time, which happens when a file/symlink/device is
     *        updated without --times and when a symlink is changed and the receiver can’t set its time.  (Note: when using an rsync  3.0.0
     *        client, you might see the s flag combined with t instead of the proper T flag for this time-setting failure.)
     *
     * o      A p means the permissions are different and are being updated to the sender’s value (requires --perms).
     *
     * o      An o means the owner is different and is being updated to the sender’s value (requires --owner and super-user privileges).
     *
     * o      A  g  means  the group is different and is being updated to the sender’s value (requires --group and the authority to set the
     *        group).
     *
     * o      The u slot is reserved for future use.
     *
     * o      The a means that the ACL information changed.
     *
     * o      The x means that the extended attribute information changed.
     *
     * One other output is possible:  when deleting files, the "%i" will output the string "*deleting" for each item that is being  removed
     * (assuming that you are talking to a recent enough rsync that it logs deletions instead of outputting them as a verbose message).

     * If you specify the --protect-args option (-s), rsync will translate the filenames you specify on the  command-line  that  are  being
     * sent to the remote host.  See also the --files-from option.
     *
     * Note  that  rsync  does not do any conversion of names in filter files (including include/exclude files).  It is up to you to ensure
     * that you’re specifying matching rules that can match  on  both  sides  of  the  transfer.   For  instance,  you  can  specify  extra
     * include/exclude rules if there are filename differences on the two sides that need to be accounted for.
     *
     * When you pass an --iconv option to an rsync daemon that allows it, the daemon uses the charset specified in its "charset" configura-
     * tion parameter regardless of the remote charset you actually pass.  Thus, you may feel free to specify just the local charset for  a
     * daemon transfer (e.g. --iconv=utf8).
